# Captioning
It is a large language model (LLM) from Huggingface that 
generates captions for images using Salesforce's BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining) framework. 
The script creates a web-based application with Gradio, where users can upload an image and receive an AI-generated descriptive caption.
